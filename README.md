# DatabaseSystems
In this course I got introduced to database management systems (DBMS) and the theory behind their design and use. <br> Throughout the course I learnt:
* Database design: How can we describe the world in terms of data?
* Data analysis: How can we pose questions about the world and obtain answers by querying this data?
* Concurrency and robustness: How may a DBMS implementation permit threads to query and modify the same units of data? And what happens when there is a system failure in the midst of such access?
* Efficiency and scalability: How does the DBMS not only store large amounts of data but also permit that data to be processed efficiently? The students will be able to design and query databases, implement applications on top of databases, as well as understand the internals of databases.
